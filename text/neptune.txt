Neptune (30 AU), though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive (equivalent to 17 Earths) and therefore more dense. It radiates more internal heat, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn.
Neptune has 13 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen.
